DESCRIPTION

Toronto police have made an arrest and laid charges today after reports of voyeurism at 40 Willcocks St. and 21 Classic Ave. this past summer and fall. The individual charged is not known to be a member of the university community. More information is available from this Toronto police media release.

Title: Voyeurism Alert
Source: University of Toronto

DESCRIPTION

The University of Toronto Campus Safety is alerting our tri-campus community about repeated acts of voyeurism at New College on St. George campus, despite an arrest in early January. The incidents have occurred in publicly accessible washrooms, and a washroom in Wilson Hall residence (the residence is key-accessed).

This alert is being shared with our full community due to the repeated, persistent nature of these incidents, and because many of you travel from Mississauga or Scarborough to St. George campus for classes, labs or other purposes. We encourage all members of our community to exercise vigilance and to report any behaviour of concern to Campus Safety (416-978-2222).

On Thursday, Feb. 15, an individual held an iPhone over an occupied shower stall in Wilson Residence (which requires a key to access). On Wednesday, Feb. 7, an individual held an iPhone over an occupied stall in a publicly accessible women's washroom in New College - in this case, a person of interest was captured on security cameras. On Jan. 9, an individual held an iPhone over an occupied shower stall in Wilson Residence.

The New College residence community was informed of each of these incidents, including the latest incident last week through direct email outreach, onsite signage, and via a Campus Safety Community Alert that was posted on washroom doors, distributed in person and slipped under bedroom doors. Multiple measures have been taken to increase security and deter the individual(s) responsible for these acts of voyeurism.

Hello UofT Zoom Community,
Please see the below notice regarding some upcoming changes to Zoom Cloud Recording storage.

WHAT:  

All Zoom recordings saved to the cloud prior to July 5, 2021, will be automatically deleted by July 5, 2022. A 365-day retention policy will be implemented as well.

WHEN:

July 5, 2022, at 4:00 PM. 

REASON:  

There is a limited amount of Zoom cloud storage available to U of T via our institutional agreement. To ensure there is always space available for day-to-day teaching and administrative needs, U of T is implementing a 365-day retention policy. 

Zoom cloud storage is intended to be temporary. The retention policy will allow enough time to transfer recordings that you wish to keep to permanent storage.

ACTION REQUIRED PRIOR TO JULY 5:

Faculty, staff and students will need to download all Zoom recordings they wish to keep and transfer them to one of the following three storage options: 

MS Stream (Faculty and Staff only)

My Media

OneDrive

To assist you with this transition, we have created three how-to videos and articles that include instructions on saving and transferring a copy of your recording made before July 5, 2022.   

Zoom to MS Stream 

Zoom to My Media 

Zoom to OneDrive

41,"Dear Statistics Student,
 
You are receiving this email because you are eligible to participate in our Course Match process and invited to rank STA courses for pre-enrolment for the upcoming academic year. PLEASE READ THE INFORMATION BELOW CAREFULLY. Please also note that the attached PDF has been updated with all links.
 
TIMELINE 
You can rank your preference for courses between June 4th – 17th, 2024
https://app.cognomos.com/rank/toronto-STAT-24
*absolutely no extensions can be made to the above deadline.
 
The course(s) in which you will be pre-enrolled/waitlisted in based on the preferences you submit through Course Match will be loaded onto ACORN on Jul 2nd - 5th, 2024. This will happen before​ course enrolment starts.
 
IMPORTANT FAQs
1. I’m currently enrolled in a summer course that is a pre-requisite for a course I want to rank. Will I meet the course pre-requisite?
Yes, as long as you successfully complete all pre-requisites before you take your course, you will meet the pre-requisites.
 
2. I’ve changed my mind, can I change my rankings?
Yes, you have until the last day of pre-enrolment (i.e., by June 17, 2024) to make changes. Changes are not permitted after June 17, 2024.
 
3. Am I guaranteed a course if I participate in the pre-enrolment process?
No. We strive to enrol students in their preferred courses as much as possible. However, if there is not enough capacity in the courses you’ve ranked, or you have fulfilled most of your program requirements already, it’s possible that you will not be enrolled into a course through this process. Note too, that even if you are pre-enrolled in your preferred course(s), you will be removed from the course during pre-requisite checks if you are missing any course pre-requisites or co-requisites when the course starts. 
 
4. My friend didn't receive this email but thinks they should have. Can they participate in this process?
If they are enrolled in a statistics program of study as of May/2024 and will have completed their 200-level STA courses, but not completed all 300+ level STA requirements for their statistics program by August/2024, they should contact our office at ug.statistics@utoronto.ca with their student number as soon as possible. If they meet the criteria, we will add them to the process. 
 
NEXT STEPS
The Course Match website will be live on June 4th! Please log into this link to submit your ranking. Additional information about this process can be found on the attached pdf document. Please review it carefully before submitting your rankings. If you are having difficulty accessing this page, please email ug.statistics@utoronto.ca with your student number.
 
In the meantime, feel free to review the past syllabi of STA courses to get a sense of what each course is about. If you know that you would prefer to avoid writing-heavy courses or taking courses that have a more significant mathematical component, this is a great way to figure out which courses might be a better fit. One caveat is that these are past syllabi, and there could be changes for the upcoming terms, even if the same instructors are teaching the course(s). Please note that information on 24-25 STA instructors is not available. We encourage you to check out your program requirements on Degree Explorer as you plan your Course Match preferences (and course enrolment) for the upcoming academic year.
 
Additionally, the courses offered in the 2024-25 academic year has been posted here. Please note that this information is preliminary and subject to change.
 
If you have received this in error, please let us know ug.statistics@utoronto.ca and you will not receive further communications about this.
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to an online advising appointment with us HERE or email us at ug.statistics@utoronto.ca to book an in-person appointment.

Dear Students,

We will continue to work towards dialogue and a peaceful resolution to the encampment at the St. George campus. We have repeatedly asked organizers of the encampment to urgently address concerning safety issues before any further discussions take place.

We have witnessed:
Hateful messages and speech as well as altercations
Large piles of firewood inside the fenced-off encampment area
Two fires burning inside the fenced area
Blocked reinforced exit points, which prevent safe passage in case of fire or medical emergency
Impeded routes for emergency vehicles around the perimeter of the encampment
Significant tent and population density within the fenced area
Non-U of T community members entering, leaving or staying in the encampment overnight
Attempts by unauthorized vehicles to gain access to a pedestrian area of campus and drive into the encampment
Because of the ongoing encampment, two demonstrations numbering in the thousands (including some with flares and smoke bombs) have come to University grounds well into the evening. As the summer term has begun, students are living in nearby residence buildings, and this poses an additional safety risk.

We know that some members of our community feel unwelcome and unsafe on campus due to the encampment. We must reiterate that the University accepts and encourages the widest range of debate, and has a high threshold for expression, including speech and imagery that is uncomfortable and offensive to some. Discrimination and harassment exceed this threshold. We are committed to peaceful protest.

Our accountability for the health and safety of our community is a critical priority. We look forward to resolving these concerns and moving on to substantive discussions as quickly as possible

We will continue to send periodic updates, and you can find a list of frequently asked questions on the UTogether site.
